JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const func = (x) => !!x && 1 == "1"

function printBasics() {
  setTimeout(
    console.log(func(0))
  ))
}

printBasics()
```
